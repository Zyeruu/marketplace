# Marketplace

A terminal-based marketplace simulation built in Java as a learning project. The system allows users to search for products, manage their cart and complete purchases. Users can also open a store and sell their own products.

## About

This project was developed with pure Java, no external frameworks, to practice and consolidate core Java concepts, including object-oriented programming, MVC architecture, SOLID principles, and dependency injection.

## Concepts Applied

- **MVC** with clear separation between Model, View and Controller layers
- **SOLID** with single responsibility, interface segregation and dependency inversion principles
- **Object-Oriented Programming** with encapsulation, polymorphism and custom exceptions
- **Dependency Injection** with dependencies instantiated and injected manually via `DependencyInjector`
- **Package by feature and by layer** organized by domain context with internal layer separation

## Requirements

- Java 17 or higher
